HTML:

A page has a list (ul) consisting of many elements (li).
Each element in the list represents one garland bulb.
CSS (design and animation):

The page background is black to make the garland look brighter.
The bulbs are arranged in a single line across the width of the screen.
They are round in shape, glowing and create a glowing effect.
Each bulb flashes at different speeds and colors (green, blue, pink).
The animation is made so that the bulbs smoothly change brightness, creating a flickering effect.
Between the bulbs there is a connecting line, imitating a wire.
The end result is the effect of a festive garland that glows and flashes beautifully. ðŸŽ„âœ¨
